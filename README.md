# Falling Block Game
This is the project that I created for my Advanced Higher Computing project in my last year of school. It is pretty obviosuly just a 
Tetris clone. I have made some updates since the version I submitted. These have just been some basic bug changes and updates to support higher DPI screens.

As part of the assessment I also needed to create a user guide for the program. This describes how to use the fesatures of the program
and how to play the game in general. To read this, click [here](Documentation/User Guide.pdf).
